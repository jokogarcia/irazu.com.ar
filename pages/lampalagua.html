        <p><strong>Lampalagua</strong> is a boutique book publisher, out of La Rioja, Argentina.</p>
        <p>I developed their web platform using <strong>Angular.js</strong> for the frontend and <strong>.NET </strong> with <strong>C#</strong> for the backend. The site features a custom CMS for managing book listings author information and purchase links from external vendors.</p>
        <p>The design of the UX has a strong focus on <strong>SIMPLICITY</strong>, this is the feature that sold the project to the customer over other canned solutions, like <strong>Shopify</strong>. It has <strong>exactly</strong> the features they want, and nothing more. With <strong>no unnecessary complexity</strong>, the platform is easy to use for both customers and administrators.</p>
        <p>This is why, for example, why there is no shopping cart feature, opting instead for external purchase links. This was requested by the customer, to avoid competing with their direct customers (book stores and retail sellers)</p>
